              Loose Grown Diamond makes all reasonable efforts to display the products listed for
              sale on its Site as accurately as possible. However, the colors we use, as well as the

              Diamond makes every effort to ensure that our products are described and priced
              accurately, in the event that an item is deemed to be priced incorrectly, Loose Grown
              Diamond reserves the right to refuse sale that item. If the pricing error is
              discovered after payment has been finalized, Loose Grown Diamond reserves the right to
              cancel the sale and refund the transaction in full. If a product offered by Loose
              Grown Diamond is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused
              condition. All items are subject to availability. We will inform you as soon as
              possible if the product(s) you have ordered are not available.

            <p>
              {' '}
              (a) <span className="text-decoration-underline"> Payment Processing </span>: Loose
              Grown Diamond provides international payment processing and order fulfillment through
              one of its designated service providers Skrill or PayPal or Klarna or Splitit as the
              Merchants-of-Record. When placing an order through the Site, your order will be
              processed using Payment Gateway checkout and payment processing services, and you
              acknowledge and agree that: (i) your payment transaction will be processed via Payment
              Gateway, not Loose Grown Diamond, and (ii) upon successful verification and
              authentication by Payment Gateway of payment information provided by you, Payment
              Gateway will accept the transaction, and purchase the products from Loose Grown
              Diamond for the sole purpose of reselling such products to you at a price equal to the
              amounts presented to and agreed-upon by you. Payment Gateway will provide the merchant
              or Loose Grown Diamond with its own payment information to purchase the products you
              have ordered, and Payment Gateway will resell such products to you and bill the
              payment information you have provided. Payment Gateway acquires flash title to the
              products when the products exit the jurisdiction of Loose Grown Diamond. After Payment
              Gateway purchases and takes title to products from Loose Grown Diamond to fulfill an
              order you have placed, you take title from Payment Gateway before the products enter
              the jurisdiction that you have designated as your address for delivery. All items
              purchased from Payment Gateway are made pursuant to a shipment contract. In the event
              of any disparity or inconsistency between the terms of any shipment contract or order
              fulfilment terms and these Terms, the terms of these Terms shall prevail to the extent
              required to resolve the disparity or inconsistency.
            </p>

            <p>
              (b) <span className="text-decoration-underline">Billing </span>: If you provide a
              credit card as your tender type, your credit card will be billed by Payment Gateway,
              and charges to your account will be accompanied by the descriptor “Loose Grown
              Diamond” or “LGD” as applicable, (or such other descriptor as the Payment Gateway may
              deploy), which denotes the Payment Gateway system, and that the Payment Gateway is the
              supplier whose products you have purchased through Payment Gateway. If you paid using
              your PayPal account, charges to your account will be accompanied by the descriptor
              “Loose Grown Diamond” (or such other descriptor as Payment Gateway may deploy). In
              either case, you will only be billed after your products have been received, processed
              and dispatched for delivery by Payment Gateway. In the event of the receipt of any
              parcel from Loose Grown Diamond containing only part of an order, Payment Gateway will
              process the products received, and will only bill for an amount commensurate with the
              price of the products therein, pro-rated amounts for shipping and/or handling, plus
              any duty, taxes, VAT (unless Payment Gateway and Loose Grown Diamond offered, and you
              accepted, the option of having your order shipped DAP (‘delivered at place’)).
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an order being fulfilled by Loose Grown
              Diamond in multiple parcels, unless expressly consented to by you, in no instance will
              the aggregate amount billed to you by Payment Gateway exceed the total amount
              presented at the time of order placement by you. If there is a technical error in the
              Payment Gateway system which processes or accepts a transaction at an exchange rate
              which is manifestly off-market, that transaction shall be void.
            </p>

            <p>
              (c) Prices for the products are available at www.loosegrowndiamond.com, but duty
              charges, VAT, taxes or surcharges levied or charged by the other country in an
              international order may be applied at the discretion of customs (and these charges
              differ from country to country and are the customer’s responsibility). Applicable
              sales taxes will be charged depending on your region. You may pay by PayPal and all
              major credit cards. The availability of a certain payment method may depend on your
              geographical location. Loose Grown Diamond may change the prices and the payment
              methods at any time but this will not affect orders with respect to which we have
              already sent you a Confirmation Notice.
            </p>

            <p>
              Customers paying by wire will receive wiring instructions once they have completed the
              check-out process. We must receive confirmation from our bank that a wire transfer has
              been completed before items can be shipped. At our sole discretion, we may require
              bank wire payment for any international order or orders in excess of $20,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you place an order on our Site, then you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Loose
              Grown Diamond will charge you through the payment method you have selected for your
              order and such other amounts that may accrue in connection with the order; (ii) that
              you will provide valid and current information for (a) yourself and (b) if applicable,
              another person, but only if you have first obtained their express consent or have the
              relevant rights to do so; (iii) that Loose Grown Diamond may use tools, software or
              services of payment processors to process transactions on their behalf; and (iv) if
              your payment is not received by Loose Grown Diamond for any reason from your card
              issuer, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon request.
